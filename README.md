# About
This mod adds new hats so you can look like your favorite VTuber!
It is based on Radsi2's CustomHats mod: https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Radsi2/CustomHats/

# Contents
- Chibidoki hair & horns. ( https://linktr.ee/chibidoki )
- More to come! Making this work took a fair amount of time so we'll see what I add next.

# Instructions
Download the mod with the Thunderstore app and new hats will automatically be added to your passport.
The Passport pagination mod is required to display all the hats in an organized manner.

If a player does not have the mod, they'll see you bald but you can still play with them.
